## Motivation for the proect

Gas prices have been fluctuating rapidly all over the world. Some goverments are proposing solutions like tax break, etc, to curb the effects of high gas prices. With this project, I am intereseted in know how much of the gas prices paid by customers end up with the government. I am interested in finding out the relationship between various types of taxes related to gasoline in the USA.

Having a clear idea on how much goes where can help me answer the following questions:

1. Which states in the USA are most and least expensive in terms of gasoline prices?

2. What are the types of taxes paid on gasoline and how much are these taxes in various states in the USA?

3. What are the factors affecting gas prices along with their respective shares?
